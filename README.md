# comment install pyenv 

Before you can install pyenv on macOS, several other software packages have to be installed before. Firstly you need the XCode command line tools, which are installed via the following command:

``xcode-select --install``

``brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib``


Installing pyenv on macOS can be done in two ways. The first one is to use the package manager Homebrew:

```brew update```
```brew install pyenv```

And after the installation has finished successfully, enter the following to add the pyenv to your $PATH and start pyenv when a new terminal window is opened (if you are not using zsh as a shell, you have to change ~/.zshrc accordingly):

```echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.zshrc```

If you donâ€™t want to install pyenv via Homebrew, you can install it directly from the GitHub repository. Enter the following command into your command line to clone the pyenv GitHub repository into your home directory:

```git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv```

```echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.zshrc```
